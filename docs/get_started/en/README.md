## Similar tools

In fact, there are many tools of this type, but each one is slightly different. Just choose one according to your needs.

If you have choice difficulties, you are recommended to use teedoc if you meet some of the following conditions:
* Use `Jupyter notebook` to write documents or code? Decisively choose teedoc
* Does the function meet your needs?
* Does the interface meet your aesthetics (you can customize css, or change the theme plug-in)
* Familiar with Python? Plug-ins and functions can be customized at any time

Other similar tools:
* docusaurus: The UI layout of teedoc is almost similar to it, but it uses vue to write, teedoc is native js, if you use vue, you can consider this
* gitbook: a tool that used to be very useful, but it is no longer maintained by the government, and it is turned to commercial. It is not recommended to use it
* docsify: Only one page is needed. Markdown is rendered in the browser instead of pre-rendered into HTML. The advantage is that it is lightweight, but SEO is not friendly. You can use its SSR function, written in nodejs
* readthedocs: A tool used by many open source projects. Like gitbook, it also has a website service. You can start writing documents after registering and logging in, or you can download the software to generate the website yourself, which is friendly to the RST format.

This article is a document written using `Markdown`, using the page effect generated by `teedoc`, see [here](https://github.com/teedoc/teedoc.github.io/blob/main/docs/ get_started/zh/syntax/syntax_markdown.md)

## Markdown basic file content format

You need to confirm in `site_config.json` that there is a `markdown` parsing plugin enabled, such as `teedoc-plugin-markdown-parser`.

Create a folder or file in the directory corresponding to `config.json`, such as `get_started/zh/syntax/syntax_markdown.md` (`README.md` will eventually generate `index.html`), and then write the content:

### Markdown header

Add a header

```markdown
---
title: markdown syntax
tags: teedoc, markdown, syntax
keywords: teedoc, markdown, syntax
desc: teedoc's markdown syntax introduction and examples
---
```

Use these keys to set article information:
* `title`: the title of the article
* `keywords`: Keywords, multiple keywords are separated by English commas`,`, will be added to the header of `html`, which is convenient for search engines to crawl, and will not be displayed on the page
* `desc`: page description, which will be added to the header of `html` for easy crawling by search engines
* `tags`: article tags, will be displayed on the page
* `id`: page `id`, will be added to the `html` tag, such as `<html id="zh_readme">...</html>`, it can be left unset, it will overwrite `config.json` Settings in
* `class`: page `class`, multiple separated by English comma`, `, you can not set it, it will overwrite the setting in `config.json`. For example, you can set the `css` style of a specific page by setting this value

### Markdown file content

The content is written using the `Markdown` grammar, because the title will be converted into the `<h1>` tag, so the content is recommended to start with the secondary title, so that a page has only one `<h1>` tag, which is convenient for search engines to crawl ,such as
```markdown
---
title: teedoc
keywords: teedoc, markdown, jupyter notebook, html, document generation, alternative gitbook, website generation, static website
desc: teedoc, convert markdown or jupyter notbook into html static webpage
id: zh_readme
class: zh_readme

## Title One

## Title Two

content. . .
```


The first-level title (`#`) is best not to be used, because the above `title` will automatically generate a first-level title (`<h1>` tag), and a page should have only one first-level title, which is convenient for search engines to crawl Included

`keywords` is the `keywords` of the generated `html` page, which will not be displayed on the page, and is mainly provided to search engines
`desc` is the `description` of the generated `html` page, it will not be displayed on the page, it is mainly provided to search engines
`tags` are the tags for the article, which will be displayed on the page


## Secondary heading

### Three-level heading

#### Four-level heading

#### Four-level heading 2

#### Four-level heading 3

##### Five-level heading

###### Sixth level heading

Up to 6 headings
